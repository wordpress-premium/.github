**[WordPress Premium](https://www.wordpress-premium.net)** offers a collection of Git repositories hosting pro and premium WordPress plugins for **a flat price of only $5/month**—no auto-renewal, no strings attached. Just pay for the month(s) you wish to have access to our carefully curated list of WordPress plugins on **[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/wordpress-premium/)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/wordpress-premium/)**, and stop paying whenever you feel like it.

## ✨ Core Values

#### [WordPress Premium](https://wordpress-premium.net/) is committed to upholding our three core values:

1. **Malware-free**: Every plugin in our repository is rigorously checked by experienced developers, which will keep your site safe and your privacy intact.

2. **Up-to-date:** Automatic reminders whenever a new version is released prompt us to make it available for our customers as soon as possible.

3. **Quality plugins:** Even though we consider requests, our WordPress pro and premium plugins list is well-curated so that we can dedicate our time to the most popular and useful ones.


> [!TIP]
>
> Until our website [wordpress-premium.net](https://wordpress-premium.net/) is fully completed, **all repositories for our pro and premium plugins are free**! Use it while it lasts 😉 If you'd like to support our efforts, [a small donation](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/thaikolja/10) goes a long way.
