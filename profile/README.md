**Welcome to WordPress Premium. [WordPress Premium](https://www.wordpress-premium.net)** offers a collection of Git repositories hosting activated and malware-free pro and premium WordPress plugins free of charge. With our well-curated and ever-expanding number of repositories, we hope you find the plugin you're looking for‚Äîfree, security-inspected, and always up-to-date.

> [!NOTE] 
> Currently, this service is free of charge. However, once we reach a certain number of plugins to manage, which requires a lot of effort, we must charge a flat fee of $5 per month to allow us to continue providing quality service according to our core values (see below). Until then, enjoy free access to our repositories on **[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/wordpress-premium/)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/wordpress-premium/)**.

## ‚ú® Core Values

#### [WordPress Premium](https://wordpress-premium.net/) is committed to upholding our three core values:

1. **Malware-free**: Every plugin in our repository is rigorously checked by experienced developers, ensuring your site remains safe and your privacy is intact.
2. **Up-to-date:** We're working hard to keep all plugins in our repository up-to-date so you always have the latest and most compatible version of the plugin.
3. **Quality Plugins:** All of our plugins are carefully selected to provide you with the most popular and most used plugins. Individual plugin requests are possible by [opening a "Request"](https://github.com/orgs/wordpress-premium/discussions/new?category=requests) under "Discussions."

## üôè Support

Keeping plugins up-to-date and checking every code for possible malware takes a lot of time. If you can, please consider leaving a small donation [via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/thaikolja/5) or [cryptocurrencies](https://www.wordpress-premium.net/wallets/) to thank us for our efforts, no matter how much.
